# Topography of Materials

Johnson's debut Chapbook is available on Bottlecap Press!

>"Juleen Eun Sun Johnson's chapbook, Topography of Materials, is a vast mural of North America, traversing glaciers to sand dunes to winter ice. Through space and time, child to adult, her artist's/photographer's eye is keyed in to the visual and tactile, the philosophical and whimsical. The poet ends "Glacier Wildness" with the couplet, "In our youth, we regret the earth; we regret/the chance to touch something." It is that desire for more that allows her to juxtapose the "impulse to destroy" and the more hopeful "Ring is infinity." Her work reflects both hard truths and sheer joy. We are obliged to follow her calling."

—Diana Garcia, author of When Living Was a Labor Camp, 2001 American Book Award Winner
